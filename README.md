# PredatorSoundBoard
Simple application of a app using the MediaPlayer library.

There isn't too much to this app, you press a button and a sound plays, as with most soundboards. This is more for demo purposes than annything else. It comprises of a few Buttons laided out on a activity and presses of any of those Buttons triggers the onClick Method of the MainActivity.java where it then decides what sound to play.
